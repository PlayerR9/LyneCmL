A personal command line handler

Complex is still Wip while Simple is only for straight forward programs and applets.

Because it is a personal command line handler, it is not recommended to use it for production; nor to rely on it for any work. ;-)

Maybe with time, it will be more robust and reliable at such point that it could be used for production.
